Input their monthly gross income and expenses.
Select whether they want to rent or buy a property and calculate the related costs.
Decide if they want to purchase a car with cash or through a loan, or if they prefer other transport options.
Calculate remaining income after handling all expenses.
Hereâ€™s an overview of the structure and features:

Features:
Income and Expense Input:

The user inputs their gross monthly income and various living costs (groceries, utilities, travel, etc.).
Tax Calculation:

Based on the user's income range, taxes are calculated and deducted from the gross income using predefined percentages for different income brackets.
Accommodation:

The user chooses whether to rent or buy a property.
If renting, the monthly rental amount is input.
If buying, the program calculates the monthly mortgage payment based on the property price, deposit, interest rate, and repayment period.
Vehicle Purchase:

The user decides whether to buy a car and selects a payment method (cash or contract).
If purchasing via a contract, the loan repayment and insurance premiums are calculated.
Remaining Income Calculation:

The remaining income after expenses, accommodation costs, and transport or car-related costs are displayed.
Key Methods:
getValidDoubleInput(): Ensures valid numeric input for expenses, income, etc.
getValidIntInput(): Ensures valid input for integers within a specific range.
getValidChoice(): Ensures the user selects between two valid options (e.g., rent/buy or yes/no).
getStringInput(): Handles simple string input, such as car model or brand names.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Error Handling: Improve the catch blocks by offering more specific feedback about invalid entries, e.g., catching InputMismatchException explicitly.
Financial Calculations: Ensure that the monthly expense and savings after each section (accommodation, transport) are consistently computed based on the correct tax bracket used for final calculations.
